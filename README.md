## Description
Deploy JS app to virtual machine from GitHub Action, while I use Terraform to provision AWS resources. Similar projects where I use GitLab CI and CloudFormation can be find here; https://gitlab.com/cicd-group-projects/gitlab-with-cloudformation

## Architecture
![design](docs/assets/designs.svg)

## Project Requirement

## Tools Used
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) - cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - preferred IDE 
- [Docker](https://wwww.docker.com/) - to build the image and push the app
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - the main iac tool

## Project Deliverables

This app shows a simple user profile app set up using 
- index.html with pure js and css styles
- nodejs backend with express module
- mongodb for data storage

All components are docker-based

## Documentation
To better understand this project, I am documenting every steps, project code and every command line arguments that I used in completing this project. For this, I have created a separate README file inside the docs directory at the root directory for this project, the directory also holds some of the project assets(images and pictures)
