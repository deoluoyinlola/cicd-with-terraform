## Documentation
To better understand this project, I am documenting every steps, project code and every command line arguments that I used. For this, I have created a separate README file inside the docs directory at the root directory for this project, the directory also holds some of the project assets(images and pictures)

## Useful tools
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/) - cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - preferred IDE 
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - the main iac tool
